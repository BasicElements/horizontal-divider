An horizontal divider.


## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Playing With The Element

If you wish to work on the element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep the element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview the element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/horizontal-divider/`, where `horizontal-divider` is the name of the directory containing it.
